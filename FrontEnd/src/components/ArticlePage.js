          The invitation from Brookings’ debate organizers asked: “Is the
          U.S.-China relationship the most consequential bilateral relationship
          for the United States in the world?” My answer is: yes. If not China,
          who? China is: one of only two nations that poses an existential
          threat to the United States. the only nation that poses a systemic
          threat to the U.S. position as the global leader, architect, and
          guardian of the post-World War II international order. the largest
          emitter of greenhouse gases—accounting for more emissions in 2022 than
          the United States and Europe combined. the second backbone of the
          world economy: the manufacturing workshop of the world, the No. 1
          trading partner of most countries in the world (including the European
          Union and Japan), and the supplier of most critical items (including
          everything green and clean) in global supply chains. both a classic
          Thucydidean rival and America’s inseparable, conjoined Siamese twin.
          An existential threat. In 2024, there are two—and only two—nations in
          the world that have nuclear arsenals that can literally erase the
          United States from the map. China is, therefore, one of only two
          nations that poses a genuinely existential threat—that is, one that
          threatens our existence—to the United States. It is one of only two
          nations with which the United States is required to survive in a
          relationship cold warriors described as MAD (mutually assured
          destruction)—a condition that creates an overriding shared imperative
          for both countries’ leaders to avoid a nuclear war in which their
          countries would be the first victims. A systemic threat. With four
          times the U.S. population, an economy that has over the past
          generation soared to overtake the United States as the world’s largest
          in purchasing power parity terms,1 and its role as most nations’ No. 1
          trading partner, the world’s leading manufacturer, and a serious
          competitor in most advanced technologies (including artificial
          intelligence), China is the only nation that could displace the United
          States as the world’s leading power. China sees itself returning to
          what it believes is its rightful place at the center of the world—a
          position from which it was toppled two centuries ago when Westerners
          with technology arrived to imperialize and humiliate it. The United
          States is a colossal ruling power that created a remarkable
          international order in the aftermath of the deadliest war in history.
          That order has allowed us—and the world—to enter a historically
          unprecedented 79th year of a long peace—a period without great power
          war. This security and economic order has enabled more people to see
          greater increases in their well-being than at any equivalent period in
          history. And no population has benefitted more dramatically from this
          than the 1.4 billion people living in China! Americans have become so
          accustomed to being at the top of every pecking order for a
          century—what we call the “American century”—that this is now part of
          our identity. The American foreign policy establishment is rightly
          proud of what American leadership has accomplished, not only for the
          United States, but for the world, and is not about to retreat
          gracefully. Are Xi Jinping and his colleagues serious about displacing
          the United States as the predominant power in the Pacific in the
          foreseeable future? I put that question to Lee Kuan Yew, the founder
          and long-time prime minister of Singapore, who was the world’s most
          insightful China watcher until his death in 2015. I will never forget
          his response. With his piercing eyes widening with incredulity—as if
          to say, “Are you joking?”—he responded: “Of course! Why not? How could
          they not aspire to be number one in Asia—and, in time, the world?”
          This rivalry creates a classic Thucydidean dynamic that magnifies
          misunderstandings, multiplies miscalculations, and increases the
          impact of incidents and accidents that have historically ended in war.
          Of the 16 cases in the last 500 years in which a major rising power
          seriously threatened to displace a ruling power, 12 ended in war.
          Inseparable, conjoined Siamese twins. What neither the United States
          nor China has come to grips with is the brute fact that the fiercest
          rivalry of all time is occurring in specific conditions in which
          neither can by itself ensure its most vital national interest: namely,
          its own survival. If accidents, incidents, or third-party provocations
          drag the rivals into war (as the assassination of an archduke did in
          1914), both could be erased from the map. President Ronald Reagan’s
          incandescent lesson—“a nuclear war cannot be won and therefore must
          never be fought”—is, thus, a foundational truth in U.S.-China
          relations. In an analog that has been called Climate MAD, on current
          trajectories, unconstrained Chinese or American greenhouse gas
          emissions could so disrupt the enclosed biosphere in which we both
          live that neither of us could survive. In the financial arena, the
          United States and China are now so deeply entangled that a financial
          crisis in one could lead to a global depression for all. When, in
          2008, Wall Street risk-taking caused a great financial crisis in the
          United States, only joint stimuli by both China and the United States
          prevented that from spiraling into a global depression. Cooperation is
          also required to contain transnational threats—the proliferation of
          nuclear weapons, pandemics, and global terrorism—sustain the benefits
          both countries’ citizens expect and demand from trade, and to advance
          science, technology, and knowledge. F. Scott Fitzgerald defined the
          test of a first-class mind as the ability to hold two contradictory
          ideas in one’s head at the same time and still function. Success in
          managing the most consequential relationship in the world will require
          the United States and China to find ways to live with two
          contradictory imperatives: to compete in the greatest rivalry of all
          time while cooperating where each nation’s survival requires it.
